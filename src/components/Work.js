      I also lead the implementation of a big data workflow that was new to the team, eliminating the need for business analysts to regularly request manual data queries for analysis.
      Finally, I volunteered for Amex Canadaâ€™s Women in Tech network and helped them make an engaging publicity video which they now use to promote and recruit more network members and propose events!`,

This resulted in improved functionality of critical features and brought up new edge cases for testing.
      I also helped investigate and fix critical back and front end production bugs that directly impacted both agents and clients.`,
